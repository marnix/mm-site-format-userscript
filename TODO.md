## Performance

- **Cache linked pages**: currently linked pages are fetched on every page load.
  Cache parsed grammar rules in `sessionStorage` (or `localStorage` for
  longer-lived caching) keyed by URL, to avoid redundant fetches when navigating
  between pages that share dependencies.

## Correctness / completeness

- **Transitive syntax loading**: currently only the syntax hints of the main
  page and one level of Ref links are loaded. A fully general parse requires
  following transitive dependencies (syntax hints of syntax hints, etc.) until a
  fixed point. Add depth-limited or full transitive loading.

## Features

- **Nested hover levels**: clicking a highlighted sub-expression cycles to the
  next-larger enclosing expression.
- **Rule tooltip on hover**: show the name of the matched syntax rule (e.g.
  `wi`) in a tooltip next to the highlighted region.
- **Highlight across steps**: when hovering a sub-expression, also highlight the
  same sub-expression in earlier proof steps that introduce it.
